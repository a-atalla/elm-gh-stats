# Elm Github release stats
This app is inspired by [github-release-stats](https://github.com/Somsubhra/github-release-stats) but built with elm.

[Live Demo](https://a-atalla.github.io/elm-gh-stats/)
## Run the app
This project uses [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org) to compile/bundle assets (*.elm, *.js, *.scss, ...etc)
also it provides a nice hot reloading while development

```shell script
# Install the compiler and the formatter globally (if you don't yet)
npm i -g elm elm-format

# Install project dependencies 
npm i 

# Run the dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
# production build created in the dist folder
npm run build
```
